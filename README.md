# stats with r tutorial

## A simple introduction to statistics and R

These notebooks are meant as an introduction to R and basic statistics. The notebooks themselves are executable so that you can try out the code, change it and adapt it to your needs. There are extensive notes on both the coding aspects and the theory of statistics behind it. 

These notes are based on the course organized by me and Jorge Carneiro at [IGC](http://qobweb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/courses/sqbibb2019/). This is a work-in-progress and will be updated on a regular basis.

### Lecture 1: Plotting in R

This notebook exemplifies the basics of R plotting. It makes use of a dataset from a [paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1029) by Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) that asks whether life expectancy is approaching its limits.
