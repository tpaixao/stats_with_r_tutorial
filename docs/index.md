These notebooks are meant as an introduction to R and basic statistics. The notebooks themselves are executable so that you can try out the code, change it and adapt it to your needs. There are extensive notes on both the coding aspects and the theory of statistics behind it. 

These notes are based on the course organized by me and Jorge Carneiro at [IGC](http://qobweb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/courses/sqbibb2019/). This is a work-in-progress and will be updated on a regular basis.

# Basic of R

## Basics of programming in R

This notebook introduces the basic notions of programming in R.

## Plotting in R

This notebook exemplifies the basics of R plotting. It makes use of a dataset from a [paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/296/5570/1029) by Oeppen and Vaupel (2002) that asks whether life expectancy is approaching its limits.

## An example of project organization

This notebook shows an example of how to generate a script that can be run on your data, indepedently of the how many data files you have and how they are organized. It is meant as a way to put in practice what we learned in the previous chapters.

# Basics of Stats with R

## The Central Limit Theorem

This notebook discusses and illustrates the Central Limit Theorem and how to use it to calculate confidence intervals for the mean.

## Hypothesis testing

This notebook discusses and illustrates the basics of hypothesis testing. We also calculate the power of particular tests and illustrate how to calculate sample sizes to be able to reliably detect a particular effect.
